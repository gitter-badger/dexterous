Dexterous is a tool for experts in any discipline, who would like to guide others through focused learning tracks. Aspirants can pursue these tracks at their own time and convenience and interact with the experts for guidance and provide feedback about the course.

It can be compared to various online learning platforms but unlike the university system there are no degrees to be awarded, no pointless competition among participants and no timeframes.

Dexterous is built upon open source technologies, and is available under [GPL v3.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). The codebase is derived from a discontinued commercial product, and is currently being maintained by me in my free time. Community contributions are more than welcome.

## Current state of progress

Dexterous is very much a work in progress - use it at your own risk.
